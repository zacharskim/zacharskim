### Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Carleton College in 2021 with a degree in statistics. I spent a few months working as an associate product manager before deciding I'd have more fun completing Jira tickets rather than writing them. 
After leaving my job, I ended up doing at batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) during the summer of 2022.
